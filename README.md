# Predictive-Analytics-for-Real-Estate-Investment
This project enhanced real estate investment decisions by using predictive analytics on a Nashville housing dataset. It focused on identifying property overpricing and underpricing with machine learning models, including Neural Networks and Gradient Boosting, involving data cleaning, correlation analysis, and model building.

Purpose:

The goal of this project is to assist real estate professionals in making data-driven investment decisions by accurately predicting whether properties are overpriced or underpriced. By leveraging advanced machine learning techniques, the project aims to uncover intricate patterns in property data that can guide investment strategies and optimize financial returns.
